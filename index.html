        <p> Hi! I am an aspiring Web Developer based in Orange County.  I first delve into
         basic HTML and CSS when I was in middle school. Just being a teenager trying to
         impress her classmates by having the best XANGA webpage.  At that time I did not
         know that being a web developer was a career option.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to school at Cal State Long Beach to get a Bachelors in Business Administration.  However, during school I worked at
         a bakery where I was able to use my imagination/creativity and transform it into reality thru cake
         decorating.  From sculpting 3d figurines with fondant and piping buttercream my imagination was able to run wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation I worked at a couple medical offices: in radiology, pediatric and finally at a nursing care center. I was
          doing medical billing and book keeping.  However, I was finding myself unfulfilled and wanting to be more creative.  My brother in law who is a
          software engineer introduced me to the world of web developing.  Thru a leap of faith I decided to change my career path October 2021
          and pursue a career in web development.  I hope that thru my lines of codes I could use my creativity to create
          applications that other people can enjoy as much as I do.  This is only the beginning, but please follow me as I hone and learn more skills.
        </p>
